In this project, I am learning how to  to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. To successfully complete this project, I am getting familiar with several key concepts related to web programming, API interaction, and asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

 **Concepts Needed:** 

*1.* HTTP Requests in JavaScript
*2.* Working with APIs
*3.* Asynchronous Programming
*4.* Command Line Arguments in Node.js
*5.* Array Manipulation and Iteration
