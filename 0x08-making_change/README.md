# Making change project
For the “0. Change comes from within” project, I tackled a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenged me to apply my understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources that were useful in completing the project successfully.<br/>

## Concepts Needed:
+ [1] **Greedy Algorithms:**<br/>
+ Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they are suitable for the coin change problem.
+ Recognizing the limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they might not provide the optimal solution.<br/>

+ [2] **Dynamic Programming:**<br/>
+ Basic principles of dynamic programming as a method to solve optimization problems.
+ The concept of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure in the context of the coin change problem.<br/>

+ [3] **Algorithmic Complexity:**<br/>
+ Analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms.
+ Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.<br/>

+ [4] **Problem-Solving Strategies:**<br/>
+ Breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
+ Iterative vs recursive approaches to dynamic programming.

+ [5] **Python Programming:**<br/>
+ Manipulating lists and using list comprehensions.
+ Implementing functions with efficient looping and conditional statements.
