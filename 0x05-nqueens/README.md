In this project, I am writing a script for the classice N queens problem. This a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
To successfully complete this project, I read to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will helped me grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
**Concepts Needed:**
Backtracking Algorithms
Recursion
List Manipulations in Python
Python Command Line Arguments
