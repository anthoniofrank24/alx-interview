In this project, I am applying my knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that I read up on for this task:
1. Bitwise Operations in Python
2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
3. Data Representation
4. List Manipulation in Python
5. Boolean Logic
